# Let's get started!

Get to the [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org).

You should see this:

This is where you'll be writing your code. Similar to how Microsoft Word and Google Docs help you edit text, **code editors** like this help you write code. The p5.js editor includes some handy features like syntax highlighting (coloring the text) to make it easier to read your code, and a play button (the triangular button in the upper-left corner) to make it easier to run your code.

Click the play button now. You should see this:

When you click the play button, the p5.js editor runs your code and shows the result in the "preview" section on the right side of the screen. For now, the only thing the code does is create a drawing canvas and give it a gray background.

The next tutorial talks more about exactly what's happening here, but for now, try changing your code to this:

{% include p5js-widget.html width=400 height=400 %}
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  circle(200, 200, 300);
}
</script>

**Side note:** The tutorials include these embedded p5.js editors to make it easier to try out code as you read. But when you're coding on your own, you should use the standalone p5.js editor since it lets you save and share your work!

Make sure your `;` semicolons and `{ }` curly brackets are all in order, and then click the play button again. Now you should see this:

Congratulations, you just wrote your first line of code! 🎉

# Homework

Over the next couple days, think about these questions:

- What programs do you use? What types of things do they tell the computer to do?
- What have you heard about different programming languages?
- What types of programs are you hoping to create?
